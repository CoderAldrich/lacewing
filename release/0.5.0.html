    <h1>Release Notes - 0.5.0</h1>

    <p>The 0.5.0 release of liblacewing is <a href="http://lacewing-project.org">now available</a>.</p>

    <h2>Reimplementation in C</h2>
    <p>
        Previous to 0.5.0, the library was written in C++98 with a set of wrappers to provide the C API.
        Starting with 0.5.0, this has been reversed: the library has been ported in its entirety to C99, with wrappers over the C functions to provide the C++ API.
    </p>

        <h3>API changes</h3>
        <p>
            Various parts of the API have been updated for consistency or correctness during the C port.  Although a best effort has been made to keep the documentation up to date with these changes, there will be errors - so any reports of issues with the 0.5.x documentation are welcome.
        </p>
        </p>
            One of the more visible API changes in 0.5.x is that all C++ classes and functions have been changed from <code>CamelCase</code> to <code>snake_case</code> to be consistent with the C API. The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> stream operator is no longer supported, but a new printf-style <code>writef</code> function is provided instead.
        </p>
        
        <h3>C99 and MSVC</h3>
        <p>
            Microsoft Visual Studio does not support C99.  In order to maintain Visual Studio support, liblacewing compiles as C++ under MSVC.
            To make this possible, any code targeting both UNIX and Windows is restricted to the subset of C99 that can compile as C++.  In particular, the following C99 features are only used in the UNIX code:

            <ul>
                <li>Implicit coersion of <code>void</code> pointers (i.e. return value of <code>malloc</code>)</li>
                <li>Designated initializers</li>
                <li>Dynamically sized arrays</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


    <h2>Other changes</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The UNIX <code>EventPump</code> will now exit the event loop if epoll or kqueue throws an error</li>

            <li>The various types of internal ref counting have been replaced with a more consistent <code>lwp_retain</code> and <code>lwp_release</code></li>

            <li>Preliminary support for <a target="_blank" href="http://swig.org/">SWIG</a></li>

            <li>Updated SPDY and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/joyent/http-parser">http-parser</a> snapshots</li>
            
            <li><code>write(3)</code> is now used for non-sockets when <code>SO_NOSIGPIPE</code> is not available</li>

            <li>Various fixes with webserver sessions</li>

            <li>New <code>ENABLE_SSL</code> option in Makefile</li>
