    <h1>Release Notes - 0.4.3</h1>

    <p>The 0.4.3 release of liblacewing is <a href="http://lacewing-project.org">now available</a>.</p>

    <h2>Windows support</h2>
    <p>
        0.4.3 has some important improvements for Windows support :-

        <ul>
            <li>Issues with the Windows implementation of <code>FDStream</code> have been resolved (solving things like truncation of <code>Webserver</code> file uploads)</li>

            <li>There is now a Visual Studio project for each example, and all are contained in the master solution</li>

            <li>Issues with building under MinGW have been resolved.  Note that it is currently necessary to configure with <code>--disable-spdy</code> for a successful build.</li>

            <li>Applications using the <code>Server::Client::NPN</code> function will now compile, although it will always return an empty string on Windows</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Stream::Close behaviour</h2>
    <p>
        In previous versions of the library, the behaviour of <a href="http://lacewing-project.org/docs/stream/Close.html">Stream::Close</a> was unclear when writes were still
        pending: some types of stream would close immediately and cancel the writes, while others would retain the internal
        structures until all pending writes had completed.  This lead to confusion as to when, if writing to and then closing
        a stream, it would be safe to assume all pending data had been written.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make this behaviour more controllable, <code>Stream::Close</code> now has a new boolean parameter <code>immediately</code>:

        <ul>
            <li>If <code>true</code>, the stream will cancel any pending writes. <code>Stream::Close</code> will always return <code>true</code>, and the stream is always closed.</li>

            <li>If <code>false</code>, the stream will close as soon as all pending writes have completed.  If no writes were
                pending, <code>Stream::Close</code> will return <code>true</code> and the stream is now closed.  Otherwise, <code>Stream::Close</code> will return <code>false</code>, and
                the <code>onClose</code> handler can be used to observe out when the stream is finally closed.</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Other changes</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The public header file <code>Lacewing.h</code> is now <code>lacewing.h</code> (lowercase)</li>

            <li>The C webserver examples have been updated for the current C API</li>

            <li>Updated to the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/iafonov/multipart-parser-c" target="_blank">multipart-parser</a></li>
