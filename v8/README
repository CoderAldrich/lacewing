This is a binding of Lacewing::Webserver to V8.  Other classes from liblacewing will follow.

Note that these bindings are licensed under the BSD license, rather than the LGPL like liblacewing itself.  That means that these bindings may be compiled directly into a closed-source executable just like V8, although the executable must still link dynamically with liblacewing to comply with the LGPL.

See the 'tests' folder for a modified V8 shell, which includes the liblacewing V8 exports.
