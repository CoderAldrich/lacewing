Ideally, all you should have to do is this:

    ./configure
    make
    make install
    
Unfortunately, I've had problems with automake on some systems - if anyone knows
what's wrong, please let me know!  If this affects you, it might be necessary to
first run autogen.sh:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install

For this, you will need a recent version of autoconf, automake and libtool
installed.
