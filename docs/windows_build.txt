DYNAMICALLY LINKING
-------------------

A Visual C++ 2008 project is provided in the 'msvc' folder.  No extra
configuration is necessary - just open the project and build.

This will produce a DLL and LIB to link to in the 'bin' folder, ready to
dynamically link to.


STATICALLY LINKING
------------------

The easiest approach to statically link Lacewing is just to include the files
from src/ and src/windows/ in your project.  It should build without problems.

If you do this, you should #define LacewingFunction before including Lacewing.h:

    #define LacewingFunction
    #include <Lacewing.h>

This will prevent Lacewing.h from trying to import the Lacewing functions as if
they were in a DLL.
