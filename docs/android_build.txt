It is possible to build liblacewing for the Android NDK.  There is an Android.mk
file provided in the 'jni' folder ready to use with ndk-build.

Unfortunately, the NDK is missing OpenSSL by default, so it is necessary to get
hold of 'libssl.so', 'libcrypto.so' and the 'openssl' include folder before you
can build.

A copy of these files is provided on lacewing-project.org [1] for convenience.
If this becomes unavailable (or if you'd rather get them yourself) you can
get the shared objects easily enough from an Android device or emulator:

  adb pull /system/lib/libssl.so
  adb pull /system/lib/libcrypto.so
    
The openssl include directory is available from git:

  git clone -b donut http://android.git.kernel.org/platform/external/openssl.git
  
Install the files in [YOUR_NDK_ROOT]/platforms/android-*/arch-arm/usr (or
somewhere else and add the search paths) and you should be good to go. :-)
