The Lacewing Relay protocol is a simple protocol for relaying messages between
multiple clients, with a familiar IRC-like structure including things like
named channels.

It currently has implementations in Python (pylacewing) and C/C++ (part of
liblacewing), and a Javascript implementation for the browser is being
developed.
