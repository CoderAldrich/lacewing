The Lacewing Relay protocol will be a simple protocol for relaying messages between multiple clients.
It can run over TCP and optionally also UDP, providing a familiar IRC-like structure with things like named channels.

Current implementations :-

- Python (pylacewing)
- C/C++ (part of liblacewing)
- ActionScript 3.0
- Multimedia Fusion 2
