Experiment to allow Lacewing to run with libev on *nix, made for a future
liblacewing node.js add-on.  To use:

- Include LacewingLEv.h
- Compile with LacewingLEv.cc
- Create a Lacewing::LEvPump
- Pass the Lacewing::LEvPump (cast it to Lacewing::Pump &) to the constructor of
  any Lacewing class

Note that this probably leaks horribly at the moment, because libev doesn't have
any EOF indication like epoll/kqueue do, and Lacewing has no way to tell the pump
when an FD is dead.  It really is just a proof of concept.
